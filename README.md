# LeetCode Solutions in C#

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), implemented in C#. My goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and practice different data structures and algorithms, while also sharing my progress.

## Structure

The solutions are organized by category to make navigation easier:

```
leetcode-csharp-solutions/
├── arrays/
│   ├── TwoSum.cs
│   ├── MaxSubArray.cs
├── linked-lists/
│   ├── ReverseLinkedList.cs
├── dynamic-programming/
│   ├── ClimbingStairs.cs
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

## Categories

The problems are grouped based on their primary data structures or algorithmic approach:

- **Arrays**: Problems related to array manipulation and traversal.
- **Linked Lists**: Solutions involving linked list operations.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Problems solved using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Graphs, Trees, Backtracking, etc.** (to be added as I progress).


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinimoreira/leetcode-csharp-solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
